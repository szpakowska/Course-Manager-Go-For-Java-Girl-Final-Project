This includes leadership in Spring Security integration for robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### User Management
Led by Monika Mieleszko, the user management module ensures seamless user authentication, and role-based access control.

### Frontend Development
Alicja Franczak has contributed significantly to the frontend development, enriching the user interface with interactive features and responsive design elements.

## Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot(with Spring Security, Spring MVC, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA)
- MySQL Database
- Thymeleaf Templating Engine
- Lombok for streamlined Java code
- Maven for project management

## Future Improvements

- Enhance testing suite to include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for better code coverage.
- Revamp the frontend for a more responsive and visually appealing user interface.
- Extend functionalities to cater not only to administrators but also instructors and students.
- Documentation enhancement: Ensure comprehensive code commenting and create detailed project documentation to facilitate team collaboration and future development.
