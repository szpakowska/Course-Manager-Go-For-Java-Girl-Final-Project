# Course Management System

A comprehensive Java-based web application designed for efficient management of users, courses, class blocks, and lessons. The system encompasses classic CRUD functionalities along with advanced features powered by JavaScript. Technologies utilized include Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Thymeleaf, Lombok, and Maven.

## Key Features

### Course/Block/Lesson Management
Spearheaded by Anna Szpakowska (https://github.com/szpakowska), this module covers the full backend and frontend implementation of course, block, and lesson management using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. This includes leadership in Spring Security integration for robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. Following the course's completion, Anna independently leads the transformation into a RESTful model integrated with Angular, leveraging her expertise to drive its development.
